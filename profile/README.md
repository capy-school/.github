## Capy School

Welcome to the Capy School organization. If you are arriving from our website or exploring our GitHub presence, this profile is a quick orientation.

### What you will find here
- **Tickets repository**: Central place to track ideas, tasks, bugs, and roadmap items.
  - Visit: [capy-school/tickets](https://github.com/capy-school/tickets)
- **Learning resources**: Repositories and notes designed for language learners with a strong linguistic focus (phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics).

### For language learners (with a linguistic focus)
- **Evidence-based approach**: We emphasize formâ€“meaning mappings, input-rich exposure, and spaced retrieval.
- **Linguistic scaffolding**:
  - Phonology: Sound systems, minimal pairs, and pronunciation practice aligned with IPA.
  - Morphology: Word formation patterns and affixation to build vocabulary depth.
  - Syntax: Sentence patterns and constructions that generalize across examples.
  - Semantics & Pragmatics: Meaning nuances, register, and context-appropriate usage.
- **Actionable materials**: Expect datasets, graded input, and tasks that foreground structure without losing communicative relevance.

### Getting started
1. Browse open items or propose new ones in the Tickets repository: [capy-school/tickets](https://github.com/capy-school/tickets).
2. Explore repositories labeled `learning`, `curriculum`, or `linguistics` for structured materials.
3. Visit our site for the live experience and updates: [www.capyschool.com](https://www.capyschool.com).
